You don't fight the incumbents. You optimize them until they are obsolete.

We are done thinking small. Equalis is not just a lending protocol; it is the **Unified Liquidity Layer** for the post-oracle era.

### Phase 1: The Trojan Horse

We launch with **Self-Secured Borrows**. Users deposit assets and borrow against them at **0% interest** (Active Credit). The protocol generates yield from the Treasury and AMM fees, boosting the user's position.

This isn't charity; it's math. If our yield outpaces AUM costs, Equalis becomes the mathematically superior place to park capital before it goes anywhere else.

### Phase 2: Supply Side Migration

Smart money follows the highest risk-adjusted return. Once the supply side sees "Risk-Free Yield" (secured by cash flow, not volatile price wicks), liquidity drains from fragile competitors and pools here.

### Phase 3: The Universal Substrate

This is where it gets interesting. We introduce **Reactive Modules**.

*   **MAM Curves:** Dutch auction liquidations that eliminate MEV.
*   **Open Encumbrance:** Third parties build strictly better lending markets on top of our liquidity.

Eventually, protocols like Aave or Morpho don't compete with us—they become **modules** running on top of our unified layer.

**We are building the road. Let them drive on it.**
