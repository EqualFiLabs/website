excerpt: "Building Riba-free infrastructure by accident (or design). Ethical finance is just good engineering."

*Note: We are currently pursuing certification but strictly adhering to the principles in the interim.*

### The Convergence

We set out to build the most robust, fair financial system possible. We ended up rebuilding Islamic Finance principles on-chain.

**Why? Because ethics is an optimization problem.**

### Riba (Usury) vs. Active Credit

*   **Principle:** Money should not generate money by the passage of time alone.
*   **Equalis:** Our 0% interest loans + Active Credit Index align perfectly. Yield comes from **profit sharing** (Mudharabah) of protocol revenue, not exploitative interest.

### Gharar (Uncertainty) vs. Deterministic Solvency

*   **Principle:** Contracts should not rely on excessive uncertainty or ambiguity.
*   **Equalis:** By removing Oracles, we remove the "gambling" element of random price wicks. Solvency is deterministic and clear.

### The Conclusion

We don't need to brand ourselves exclusively as "Islamic DeFi" to win. We simply build the **superior architecture**. It just so happens that the systems that have survived for 1,400 years knew something about stability that modern TradFi forgot.
