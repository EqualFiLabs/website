How can we offer 0% interest loans? Is it a Ponzi?

No. It is a realignment of incentives.

### The Old Model: Usury

In Aave or Compound, borrowers pay interest to lenders.
*   **Borrower:** Bleeds capital over time.
*   **Lender:** Earns passive (lazy) yield.
*   **Protocol:** Takes a small cut.

### The Equalis Model: Activity

In Equalis, the yield does not come from the borrower's pocket. It comes from the **Protocol's Revenue**.

1.  **Treasury Operations:** Idle assets are deployed into safe, yield-bearing strategies (LSDs, delta-neutral AMM positions).
2.  **AMM Fees:** The protocol owns its own liquidity and earns swap fees.
3.  **Redistribution:** This revenue is directed to the **Active Credit Index (ACI)**.

### Qualification

To earn this yield, lenders cannot just sit there. They must be **active**.
*   They must refresh their positions every 24 hours.
*   They must participate in governance or liquidity provision.

This turns "Passive Capital" into "Productive Capital." Borrowers get cheap access to liquidity, and active lenders get superior yields powered by the collective success of the ecosystem.
